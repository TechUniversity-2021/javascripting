# JavaScript Higher Order Functions

## What is Functional Programming
In most simple term, Functional Programming is a form of programming in which you can pass functions as parameters to other functions and also return them as values. In functional programming, we think and code in terms of functions.

### JavaScript implements functional programming

### First-Class Functions

In JavaScript functions are a special type of objects. They are Function objects. For example:

```
function greeting() {
  console.log('Hello World');
}
// Invoking the function
greeting();  // prints 'Hello World'
```

To prove functions are objects in JavaScript, we could do something like this:
```
// We can add properties to functions like we do with objects
greeting.lang = 'English';
// Prints 'English'
console.log(greeting.lang);
```

Note — While this is perfectly valid in JavaScript, this is considered a harmful practice. You should not add random properties to the function objects, use an object if you have to.

In JavaScript, everything you can do with other types like object, string, or number, you can do with functions. You can pass them as parameters to other functions (callbacks), assign them to variables and pass them around etc. This is why functions in JavaScript are known as **First-Class Functions**.

### Assigning Functions to Variables
We can assign functions to variables in JavaScript. For example:
```
const square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
// prints 25
square(5); 
```

We can also pass them around. For example:
```
const foo = square;
// prints 36
foo(6);
```

### Passing Functions as Parameters
We can pass functions as parameters to other functions. For example:

```
function formalGreeting() {
  console.log("How are you?");
}
function casualGreeting() {
  console.log("What's up?");
}
function greet(type, greetFormal, greetCasual) {
  if(type === 'formal') {
    greetFormal();
  } else if(type === 'casual') {
    greetCasual();
  }
}
// prints 'What's up?'
greet('casual', formalGreeting, casualGreeting);
```

Now that we know what first-class functions are, let’s dive into Higher-Order functions in JavaScript.

## Higher-Order Functions
Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. In simple words, **A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.**

For example,
Array.prototype.map,
Array.prototype.filter
Array.prototype.reduce
are some of the Higher-Order functions built into the language.

### Higher-Order Functions in Action
Let’s take a look at some examples of built-in higher-order functions and see how it compares to solutions where we aren’t using Higher-Order Functions.

### Array.prototype.map
The `map()` method creates a **new array** by calling the **callback function** provided as an argument on every element in the input array.
The `map()` method will take every returned value from the callback function and creates a new array using those values.
The callback function passed to the `map()` method accepts 3 arguments: `element`, `index`, and `array`.

Let’s look at some examples:
**Example 1#**
Let’s say we have an array of numbers and we want to create a new array which contains double of each value of the first array. Let’s see how we can solve the problem with and without Higher-Order Function.

- Without Higher-order function

    ```
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    arr2.push(arr1[i] * 2);
    }
    // prints [ 2, 4, 6 ]
    console.log(arr2);
    ```

- With Higher-order function `map`

    ```
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = arr1.map(function(item) {
    return item * 2;
    });
    console.log(arr2);
    ```
    We can make this even shorter using the arrow function syntax:

    ```
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = arr1.map(item => item * 2);
    console.log(arr2);

**Exercise 1#**
Let’s say we have an array containing the birth year of different persons and we want to create an array that contains their ages.
```
const birthYear = [1975, 1997, 2002, 1995, 1985]
// Tip: Assume current year(2021) for calculating age
```

### Array.prototype.map
The `filter()` method creates a **new array** with all elements that pass the test provided by the **callback function**. The callback function passed to the `filter()` method accepts 3 arguments: `element`, `index`, and `array`.

Let’s look at some examples:
**Example 1#**
Let’s say we have an array which contains objects with name and age properties. We want to create an array that contains only the persons with full age (age greater than or equal to 18).

- Without Higher-order function

    ```
    const persons = [
    { name: 'Peter', age: 16 },
    { name: 'Mark', age: 18 },
    { name: 'John', age: 27 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 14 },
    { name: 'Tony', age: 24},
    ];
    const fullAge = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
    if(persons[i].age >= 18) {
        fullAge.push(persons[i]);
    }
    }
    console.log(fullAge);
    ```
- With Higher-order function `filter`

    ```
    const persons = [
    { name: 'Peter', age: 16 },
    { name: 'Mark', age: 18 },
    { name: 'John', age: 27 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 14 },
    { name: 'Tony', age: 24},
    ];
    const fullAge = persons.filter(person => person.age >= 18);
    console.log(fullAge);
    ```

### Array.prototype.reduce
The `reduce` method executes the callback function on each member of the calling array which results in a single output value. The reduce method accepts two parameters: 1) The reducer function (callback), 2) and an optional `initialValue`.

- The reducer function (callback) accepts four parameters: `accumulator`, `currentValue`, `currentIndex`, `sourceArray`

- If an `initialValue` is provided, then the accumulator will be equal to the `initialValue` and the currentValue will be equal to the first element in the array

- If no `initialValue` is provided, then the `accumulator` will be equal to the first element in the array and the `currentValue` will be equal to the second element in the array.

**Example 1#**
Let’s say we have to sum an array of numbers:

- Without Higher-order function
    ```
    const arr = [5, 7, 1, 8, 4];
    let sum = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + arr[i];
    }
    // prints 25
    console.log(sum);
    ```

- With Higher-order function `reduce`
    ```
    const arr = [5, 7, 1, 8, 4];
    const sum = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue) {
    return accumulator + currentValue;
    });
    // prints 25
    console.log(sum);
    ```
    Every time the reducer function is called on each value in the array, the `accumulator` keeps the result of previous operation returned from the reducer function, and the `currentValue` is set to the current value of the array. In the end the result is stored in the sum variable.

    We can also provide an initial value to this function:
    ```
    const arr = [5, 7, 1, 8, 4];
    const sum = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue) {
    return accumulator + currentValue;
    }, 10);
    // prints 35
    console.log(sum);
    ```

You can see that using High-order function made our code **cleaner, more concise and less verbose**.

**Exercise 2#**
Learn about more high order functions:
- `Array.prototype.every`
- `Array.prototype.some`
- `Array.prototype.forEach`
- `Array.prototype.slice`

## Creating Our own Higher-Order Function
Let’s say, we have an array of strings and we want to convert this array to an array of integers, where each element represent the length of the string in the original array - **Without using any native high order functions**

```
const strArray = ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'PHP', 'Java', 'C'];

function mapForEach(arr, fn) {
  const newArray = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(
      fn(arr[i])
    );
  }
  return newArray;
}

const lenArray = mapForEach(strArray, function(item) {
  return item.length;
});
// prints [ 10, 6, 3, 4, 1 ]
console.log(lenArray);
```

In the above example, we created an Higher-order function `mapForEach` which accepts an array and a callback function `fn`. This function loops over the provided array and calls the callback function `fn` inside the `newArray.push` function call on each iteration.

The callback function `fn` receives the current element of array and returns the length of that element, which is stored inside the `newArray`. After the for loop has finished, the `newArray` is returned and assigned to the `lenArray`.

In a nutshell, a Higher-order function is a function that may receive a function as an argument and can even return a function. Higher-order functions are just like regular functions with an added ability of receiving and returning other functions are arguments and output.
